# zk-starks

zk-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge) are a type of zero-knowledge proof system that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information about the statement itself. They are an improvement over zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive ARguments of Knowledge), as they are more scalable, transparent, and secure.

zk-STARKs use a different approach to constructing zero-knowledge proofs than zk-SNARKs. Instead of using a mathematical structure called a "commitment scheme," they use a technique called "friable functions," which allows them to be more efficient and transparent.

zk-STARKs have several properties that make them appealing for use in various applications:

    Scalability: zk-STARKs can prove statements about large datasets efficiently, without requiring a trusted setup.

    Transparency: zk-STARKs do not require a trusted setup, and the proof construction and verification process is publicly verifiable.

    Security: zk-STARKs are based on strong cryptographic assumptions and have been proven to be secure against various attacks.

zk-STARKs have been used in various applications, such as privacy-preserving transactions, verifiable computations, and secure multi-party computation.
